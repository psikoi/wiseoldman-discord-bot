# Notifications

Besides commands, this bot can also send notifications to your Discord server when something happens to one of your group members (new achievements, HCIM death, etc), or to your competitions (started, ended, starting soon, etc).

For this, the bot needs to know what your group is and where to send those notifications, and since there are many types of notifications, you need to either specify where to receive each type, disable a type, or just **assign a default notifications channel**.

<br />

:::caution
Notifications are only sent if configured properly beforehand. Learn more about these configurations here:

- [Configuring Group ID](/commands#config-group)
- [Configuring Notifications](/commands#config-notifications)

The bot also needs certain permissions to be able to speak in the channel you want to receive notifications in without being mentioned. Here are the current required permissions:

- Send messages
- Manage messages
- Embed links
- Attach files
- Use application commands
